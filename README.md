# Pokemon-Battle
This project demonstrates HTML, CSS, and Javascript in order to create a simplified version of the popular Pokemon Trading Card Game

## API's Used:
[PokemonTCG API](https://pokemontcg.io/)

## Description:
- The PokemonTCG API allows users to fetch pokemon card data: card images, metadata, and pokemon stats. 
- This is the same turn-based card game, but stripped down to make it simple and for demonstration purposes only
- Players will fight a computer "trainer," taking turns attacking each other

## How to get started:
- On the homescreen, players will be able to search for their favorite pokemon
- The returned results are the cards for the respective pokemon searched
- Clicking on the card allows players to add them to their party 
- When four Pokemon are added, the battle agains the computer trainer begins
- The player can click on the corresponding attacks trading damage with the computer
- When the player or the computer has no Pokemon left in their party, the game is over and the option to play again is presented

## About this project:
This is the very first project assigned through General Assembly and is meant to be for educational purposes only.
